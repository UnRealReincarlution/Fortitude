This is Fortitude

Currently in a pre-alpha phase of development, this is the runner up to my previous, now 'Fortitude-Old' project in which I decided to recreate discord to test my personal ability and learn new things about firebase, javascript and web development.

Now, almost a year later - I intend to do it again, this time using a more refined development stack of NextJS (react) and Typescript bundled with switching to supabase, I wish to see how much faster and more efficent I have become, aswell as seeing improvements in design ideas, responsiveness etc.

Please note, this is for my learning purposes only and is not intended as an actual product to be used.

✨ Thanks ✨
